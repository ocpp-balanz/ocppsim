# Docker example

'docker-compose.yaml` example of running two parallel simulators. Review setup against chargers in `balanz` demo
model in `data/model` directory.

Adjust `url` configuration in `server` section as appropriate. Alternatively, can be set via `BALANZ_SERVER_URL`
environment variable which will take precedence, if set.
